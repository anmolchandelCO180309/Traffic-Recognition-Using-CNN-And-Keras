# Traffic-Recognition-Using-CNN-And-Keras
In this project, we created a deep neural network model which will be capable of classifying traffic signs image into several categories. We will be able to read and interpret traffic signs using this model, which is a critical job for all autonomous cars.

# Dataset Used
For this project, we used the Kaggle-hosted public dataset Traffic Signs Dataset. The collection in this dataset includes almost 50,000 pictures of various traffic signals. Additionally, it was divided into 43 distinct classes. The dataset was very varied; some classes contained many pictures, while others have few. The dataset was about 300 MB in size. The dataset was divided into a train folder contained pictures for each class, it also contained a test folder of images for testing our model.

# Prerequisites For The Project
This project required:
• Keras - Keras is an open-source software framework that offers a Python interface for artificial
neural networks. Keras serves as a gateway to the TensorFlow library.
• Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical
mathematics extension NumPy
• Scikit-learn - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming
language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support
vector machines
• Pandas - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data
manipulation and analysis
• PIL - Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python
programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different
image file formats
• Image classification - Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of
pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules.

# Proposed System/Methodology /Architecture
• Exploration of the dataset

• Construction of a CNN model

• Training and validation of the model

• Validation of the model using a test dataset

# Results
In this Python project with source code, we have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 95% accuracy and also visualized how our accuracy and loss changes with time, which is pretty good from a simple CNN model.
